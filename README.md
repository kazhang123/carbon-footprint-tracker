# Carbon Footprint Tracker

### UBC CPSC 210

**Track your impact on the climate with a carbon footprint calculator. Monitor how each part
of your daily life is contributing to climate change from your daily lifestyle choices.** 
 
 This application is aimed to be used by the average person to provide insight into their impact on the climate.
 The application aims to promote awareness and guidance towards a sustainable future. 
 I started this project to educate myself on urgent climate matters and enlighten others towards the relevancy of sustainability.
 
 Developed using Java Swing.
